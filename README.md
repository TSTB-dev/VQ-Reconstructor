# VQ-Reconstructor
Vector-Quantized Transformer for Industrial Image Anomaly Detection

This repository is an implementation of Vector-Quantized Transformer-based reconstruction model for industrial image anomaly detection (MVTecLOCO). We provide these functionalities to validate the efficiency/problems with VQ-Transformer-based reconstruction model.
- Training scripts
- Evaluating Scripts
- Codebook visualization
- Ablation results (i.e. Hierachical quantization, number of blocks, ...)
